Designing my portfolio was more than just picking colors.

‚ú® **Main Focus Areas**
1. Design consistency
2. Subtle interactive animations
3. Fast load times

üß† **Tools Used**
- Figma
- Tailwind CSS
- GSAP for animations

üéØ Outcome:
- Visitors stayed longer.
- Recruiters mentioned how interactive it felt.

Always remember ‚Äî portfolio = personality.

React performance is crucial when scaling your app.

üß™ **Key Practices**
- UseMemo for expensive calculations
- Memoize components with React.memo
- Avoid inline functions in JSX
- Use dynamic imports + lazy loading

üîß Example:
\`\`\`js
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensive(), [input]);
\`\`\`

üî• Bonus:
Use React Profiler to track bottlenecks visually.

    tag: "Tailwind",
    content: `
Tailwind CSS empowers developers to create responsive designs rapidly without writing custom CSS.

### üîÆ Why It Feels Like Magic:
- Utility-first classes keep styles inline and organized
- Breakpoints are built-in: \`sm:\`, \`md:\`, \`lg:\`, etc.
- Easily customizable through \`tailwind.config.js\`

### üé® Custom Themes:
You can extend Tailwind with your own colors, spacing, and more:
\`\`\`js
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      brand: '#1da1f2',
    },
  }
}
\`\`\`

### üì± Responsive Layouts:
Use Tailwind‚Äôs responsive modifiers like:
\`flex flex-col md:flex-row justify-center items-center\`

No need to context switch between HTML and CSS ‚Äî it's all in one place.

Tailwind feels like writing CSS at the speed of thought ‚ú®.

    tag: "React Native",
    content: `
React Native animations can make your app feel polished and responsive.

### üöÄ Libraries Used:
- **Reanimated 2**: Powerful gesture-based animations
- **Moti**: Simplifies Reanimated with props-based API

### üß© Example with Moti:
\`\`\`js
<MotiView
  from={{ opacity: 0, translateY: 50 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, translateY: 0 }}
  transition={{ type: 'spring' }}
>
  <Text>Hello Animation</Text>
</MotiView>
\`\`\`

### ‚ú® Tips:
- Keep animations under 300ms for responsiveness
- Use \`useAnimatedScrollHandler\` for scroll-based effects
- Combine Moti + Reanimated for complex flows

Animations aren't just visual ‚Äî they guide the user's journey.

Once you're comfortable with React basics, mastering patterns can improve reusability and code clarity.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Render Props
Let child components decide rendering:
\`\`\`js
<DataProvider render={(data) => <Chart data={data} />} />
\`\`\`

### üß± Compound Components
Components that work together:
\`\`\`js
<Tabs>
  <Tabs.List />
  <Tabs.Panel />
</Tabs>
\`\`\`

### ü™ù Custom Hooks
Extract reusable logic:
\`\`\`js
function useDarkMode() {
  const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState(false);
  useEffect(() => { ... }, [enabled]);
  return [enabled, toggle];
}
\`\`\`

These patterns reduce duplication and increase scalability in large React projects.

With Next.js becoming the go-to React framework, here's a breakdown.

### üß© Why Choose Next.js?
- SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
- Built-in API routes
- SEO optimization
- File-based routing

### ü§î When React (CRA) Still Works?
- Internal dashboards
- SPA with limited SEO needs
- Custom routing logic

‚ú® Verdict: For most modern apps, Next.js is the default choice in 2025.

Tailwind supports dark mode out of the box.

### ‚úÖ Setup
In \`tailwind.config.js\`:
\`\`\`js
darkMode: 'class',
\`\`\`

Then use utilities like:
- \`bg-white dark:bg-black\`
- \`text-black dark:text-white\`

### üí° Toggle with JS
\`\`\`js
document.documentElement.classList.toggle('dark');
\`\`\`

Works beautifully with localStorage too.
